    Hi! I'm Jenn. <span class="OffsetEmoji">&#128075;</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#8212; a new front-end dev and happy human.
    <br>
    <br>
    I've always loved making things. But when it came to being a working adult in Florida, my apparent female destiny was to work in a hospital and wear 
    rubber gloves. I did that for a bit, but it wasn't really my thing.
    <br>
    <br>
    I moved to Seattle a couple years ago to study code and give making things for a living a shot. Turns out, I'm pretty good at it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm currently seeking an internship at a company that ships consumer digital products. I want to work with people that challenge me and push me to be the best I can be. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Let's make some cool stuff together.

    Iâ€™m profient in CSS and all its modern forms. I write code in Sublime. I use <a href="https://github.com/jennminerva" target="_blank">github</a> for all my projects and collaborations. Grunt might be old school but it gets the job done. I have some experience working within node apps but not much server side js under my belt.
